## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

- The company wants to know:

	Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
	How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Conclusions
- The top five positive variables which increase property prices are:
	GrLivArea
	OverallQual
	BsmtFinSF1
	OverallCond
	GarageArea
	LotArea

- The neagtive variable which decrease the property prices are:
	PropAge
	Heating_Grav
